# Caesar Cipher

A simple Python script to **encode and decode messages** using the classic Caesar cipher technique. This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the shift cipher with user interaction from the command line.

## About

The **Caesar cipher** is one of the simplest and oldest known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

Plaintext: abc
Shiftnumber=3
Ciphertext: def


This project lets users enter a message and choose whether to **encode** or **decode** it using a given shift number.

## Features

- Encode messages by shifting letters forward.  
- Decode messages by shifting letters backward.  
- Works with lowercase alphabetic characters.  
- Ignores any characters that are not in the alphabet (e.g., spaces, punctuation).  

## How to Use
Clone or run the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahaasmita60-ship-it/Caesar-Cipher.git
cd Caesar-Cipher
python caesar_cipher.py
